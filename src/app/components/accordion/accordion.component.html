          <p>Yes! Our online doctors are U.S. Board Certified with verified medical licenses and a professional
            reputation that we personally research and find in good standing within the medical community. They exhibit
            expertise and leadership in their field. We also only present doctors who have a beloved bedside manner and
            maintain stellar patient reviews. We want you to have the best telehealth experience possible. Our
            philosophy is that if we wouldn't want our family members seeing our doctors, we wouldn't want you to
            either!</p>

          <p>As a patient, you can still benefit from access to a responsive, trusted HealthTap online doctor â€” even if
            you already have a doctor near you that you see in person! A HealthTap doctor is usually more affordable and
            convenient for most issues. And for the few occasions where you need to see someone in person, you can share
            your online medical records with your local physicians to pick up where we left off!</p>
